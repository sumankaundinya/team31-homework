Aloo Paratha Recipe
Ingredients:
For the Dough:

2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp oil or ghee
Water (as needed for kneading)
Extra flour for rolling
For the Filling:

3 large potatoes (boiled and mashed)
1 onion (finely chopped, optional)
2 green chilies (finely chopped)
1 tsp ginger-garlic paste (optional)
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp garam masala
1 tsp red chili powder
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp cumin powder
Salt to taste
A handful of fresh cilantro (chopped)
1/2 tsp amchur powder (dry mango powder, optional)
1 tbsp ghee or oil for cooking
Instructions:
Prepare the Dough:

In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Add the oil or ghee.
Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.
Prepare the Filling:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the boiled and mashed potatoes with chopped onions (if using), green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, cumin seeds, garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, salt, cilantro, and amchur powder (if using).
Mix everything well until all the spices are evenly distributed.
Shape the Parathas:

Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a golf ball).
Roll one dough ball into a small, flat disc (about 4 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin and some dry flour.
Place a generous amount of the potato filling in the center of the dough circle. Be sure not to overfill.
Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling, sealing it inside.
Flatten the stuffed dough ball slightly and roll it out gently into a larger circle, about 6-8 inches in diameter. If needed, dust with flour to prevent sticking.
Cook the Aloo Paratha:

Heat a tawa (griddle) or a non-stick pan on medium-high heat.
Place the rolled paratha onto the hot tawa. Once you see bubbles forming on the surface, flip it over.
Brush the top side with a little ghee or oil and flip again. Press lightly with a spatula to help it cook evenly.
Continue flipping and pressing until both sides are golden brown and crispy, with the paratha cooked through.
Serve:

Serve hot with yogurt, pickle, or a side of fresh salad.
