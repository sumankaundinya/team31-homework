Ingredients:
For the Chicken Marinade:

1 kg chicken (cut into pieces)
1 cup yogurt
2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
1 tsp red chili powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp garam masala powder
1/2 tsp coriander powder
Salt to taste
2 tbsp lemon juice
A handful of mint leaves (chopped)
A handful of cilantro (chopped)
For the Rice:

2 cups basmati rice
1 bay leaf
4-5 cloves
1-2 cardamom pods
1-inch cinnamon stick
1 tsp cumin seeds
Salt to taste
For the Biryani:

3 medium-sized onions (thinly sliced)
2 tomatoes (chopped)
2 green chilies (slit)
2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
1/4 cup cooking oil
2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)
1/2 cup milk (optional, for saffron milk)
A pinch of saffron strands (optional, soaked in warm milk)
A handful of fried onions (for garnishing)
Fresh mint and cilantro for garnish
Instructions:
Marinate the Chicken:

In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, salt, lemon juice, chopped mint, and cilantro.
Mix everything well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight for deeper flavor).
Prepare the Rice:

Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
In a large pot, bring water to a boil, adding salt, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and cumin seeds.
Add the rice and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the rice is 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set the rice aside.
Cook the Chicken:

Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker.
Add the sliced onions and fry them until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions for garnishing.
In the same oil, add ginger-garlic paste and sauté until fragrant. Then, add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies and cook until soft.
Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat until the chicken is cooked through and the gravy thickens (about 15-20 minutes).
Layering the Biryani:

In a separate large pot or pressure cooker, start layering the biryani:
First, add a layer of the cooked chicken mixture at the bottom.
Then, add a layer of the partially cooked rice.
Repeat with another layer of chicken and rice, ensuring the chicken mixture is well distributed.
If using saffron milk, pour it over the top layer of rice along with a drizzle of ghee and a sprinkle of fried onions.
Final Cooking (Dum Process):

Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to lock in the steam.
Cook the biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes. You can place a heavy pan underneath the pot to avoid direct heat (this is called "dum").
Alternatively, you can cook the biryani in a preheated oven at 180°C for 20 minutes.
Garnish and Serve:

Once done, fluff the biryani gently with a fork. Garnish with fresh mint, cilantro, and the reserved fried onions.
Serve hot with raita (yogurt-based side dish), salad, or boiled eggs.
